SEC-Edgar-Crawler
=================

|Build Status|

Getting filings of various companies at once is really a pain, but
SEC-Edgar does that for you. You can download all of a company’s
periodic reports, filings and forms from the EDGAR database with a
single command.

Installation
------------

You may have to install the package using pip:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install SECEdgar

or

You can clone the project or download it as zip.

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/rahulrrixe/SEC-Edgar.git  
   $ cd SEC-Edgar  
   $ python setup.py install

Running
-------


⚠️ The following code is experimental in v0.1.5. Please refer to docs on how to use the `SecCrawler` class if installing v0.1.4 or earlier. ⚠️

To run it, start python shell

.. code:: console

    >>> from SECEdgar.filings import Filing, FilingType
    >>> my_filings = Filing(cik='0000320193', filing_type=FilingType.FILING_10Q) # 10-Q filings for Apple (NYSE: AAPL)
    >>> my_filings.save('~/path/to/dir') # Saves last 15 10Q reports from AAPL to ~/path/to/dir

This will download the past 15 10-Q filings made by Apple.

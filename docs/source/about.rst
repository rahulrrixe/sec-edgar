Getting filings of various companies at once is really a pain, but secedgar does that for you.
You can download all of a company's periodic reports, filings and forms from the SEC EDGAR database with a single command.

What is EDGAR?
--------------
According to `Investopedia <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/edgar.asp>`_, EDGAR — Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval — is the electronic
filing system created by the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the
efficiency and accessibility of corporate filings. The system is used by all
publicly traded companies when submitting required documents to the SEC.
Corporate documents are time sensitive, and the creation of EDGAR has greatly
decreased the time it takes for corporate documents to become publicly available.

Parser
======

Starting in version 0.3.0, secedgar will start to implement a general-purpose parser.

This is expected to be an ambitious task and may not be feasible for all filing types.
However, given user feedback, we feel that it is worth a shot. Please note that
parsing will remain experimental for the foreseeable future.

Bugs:
~~~~~

* Fix count attribute to fetch desired number of filings. ``SECEdgar`` will now either fetch specified number or, if not enough filings exist, all filings will be fetched.
* Fix `_VALID_FILING_TYPES` so that EDGAR fetches correct filing type (thanks @raffam)

Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Introduce ``_EDGARBase`` class
